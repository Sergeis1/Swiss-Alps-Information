  <h2>Animals</h2>
  <p><strong>Chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra)</strong> — The chamois is a species of goat-anntelope. They are native to mountain regions of Western Asia and Europe, often found in the swiss alps. Some species are strictly protected in the EU. The chamois is a very small bovid. They usually reach a heaight of 80cm and 140cm in length at 30-60kg. Both females and males have small horns which are hooked backwards near the top. Female chamois live in herds from 15 to 30 animals, while males usually prefer to live alone for most of the year. During late november/early december, males engage in battles to get attention of the unmated females. If the mother of a chamois is killed, other females in the herd might try to raise the young. Chamois are herbivores and eat many plants such as: highland grasses, herbs and bark fomr trees. Chamois goats can live up to 22 years old, but the average lifespan is 15-17 years in the wild. Chamoi meat is considered to be very tasty, which is why they are a popular game animal in uprotected regions.<span class="cite">(Swiss National Park, n.d.)</span>.</p>

  <p><strong>Ibex (Capra ibex)</strong> — The ibex is a species of wild goat, with the male having their distinct large curved horns. They are usually found in Eurasia, North and East Africa. A male ibex is a buck, a female is a doe, their kids are called kids. Males are usually larger and heavier than the doe, especially the size difference is noticed in the horns, which appear at birth and grow through their entire life. They grow up ot be around 60kg in weight. Ibex were commonly found on Egyptian and Mediterranean pottery as decorations.<span class="cite">(Swiss National Park, n.d.)</span>.</p>

  <p><strong>Marmot (Marmota marmota)</strong> — Marmots are large ground squirrels. There are roughly 15 species in Asia, Europe and North America. During the summer they re very active and can be found in groups. During the winter they are not seen because they hibernate underground. They the biggest and heaviest member of the squirrel familly. Marmots have short legs, big claws adapted for digging. Their fur colour is based roughly on their enviroment. In open habitats they are more pale, while in forests they tend to have a darker colour. They weigh around 2kg.<span class="cite">(Swiss National Park, n.d.)</span>.</p>

  <p><strong>Lynx (Lynx lynx)</strong> — Lynx come from the cat familly. They have a short tail, large padded paws and long whiskers on the face. Under the nexk they have a ruff, which sometimes resembles a bow tie, but it is often not visible. Their colours vary from goldish brown to white, often marked with dark spots. The lunx usually live in solitary, but sometimes they can travel and hunt in small groups. Mating happens in late winter and once a year a female gives birth to 1-4 kittens.<span class="cite">(Breitenmoser, 1998; swissinfo.ch, 2021)</span>.</p>

  <p><strong>Arctic grayling (Thymallus thymallus)</strong> — The arctic grayling is a species of freshwater fish in the Salmonidae family. Often found in Arctic and pacific lakes, siberia and european lakes. They go up to a maximum length of 80cm and around 10lbs. They have different populations living in either lakes, rivers or streams. Arctic grayling usually prefer cold waters of small or medium sized lakes/rivers. They spawn in the spring where adult fish look fow shallow areas of rivers with fine sand. Eggs are layed and feltilized. <span class="cite">(Eawag, 2023; FishBase, 2017)</span>.</p>

  <p><strong>Opossum shrimps (Mysidae)</strong> — Opposum shrimp also known as Mysida, is a small shrimp like crustacean. Mysids are found throughout the world in both shallow and deep marine waters, but they are also found in fresh water ecosystems. They have two pais of antennae and one pair of large eyes. The body segments are covered with an exoskeleton. Most of them are 5-25mm and vary in colour from pale to completely transperent, sometimes found to be orange or brown. They love to burrow in the mud or sand where they usually stay during the day but at night they come out in a planktonic state. Most of them are omnivores and eat algae, but adults can prey on their younglings.<em>Hemimysis anomala</em> <span class="cite">(Jacquet et&nbsp;al., 2023)</span>.</p>

  <h3>How animals connect</h3>
  <p>Predators like lynx control the herbivores; marmots transmit seeds and feed raptors; Aquatic insects feed graylings; and alpine vegetation stabilizes soils and supplies coverage and home for animals. These links keep the ecosystem stable and running.</p>
