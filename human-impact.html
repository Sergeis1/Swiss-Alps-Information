  <h2>Human Impact</h2>
  <p>Tourism, litter, habitat fragmentation, and climate change all have a very strong negative effect on Alpine ecosystems. The Alps are globally important for biodiversity, yet are always overlooked in conversations about the issues we face in the world <span class="cite">(WWF, n.d.)</span>. Switzerland has tried to get stronger protections for its mountains, but a 2024 referendum to expand protection measures was rejected, keeping conservation just a public discussion <span class="cite">(Reuters, 2024; AP, 2024)</span>.</p>

  <h3>Everything is connected</h3>
  <p>Plants like cushion species reduce erosion and create sheltered micro‑climates for many different species, such as insects and small mammals. Marmots spread their seeds. Grayling depend on clean, cold water and prey like water insects. Losing any one of these will weaken the rest <span class="cite">(Chen et&nbsp;al., 2017; swissinfo.ch, 2021; Jacquet et&nbsp;al., 2023)</span>.</p>
